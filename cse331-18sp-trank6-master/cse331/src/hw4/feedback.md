### Score: 111/122
---

**Problem 0 - Polynomial Arithmetic:** 12/14

- a. 2/4 -2: x doesn't seem to be relevant to multiplying the terms t_p and t_q
- b. 6/6
- c. 4/4

**Problem 1 - Ratnum:** 8/9

- a. 2/3 -1: equals also needs to be changed
- b. 3/3
- c. 3/3

**Problem 2 - RatTerm:** 25/30

15/15 scripts
6/7 style -1: consecutive if-tests that are mutually exclusive should be if/else-ifs
- try to be consistent when using tabs vs. spaces
- a. 2/2
- b. 1/3 -2: equals and checkRep also need to be changed
- c. 1/3 -2: checkRep also needs to be changed and you should explain which invariant is preferable

**Problem 3 - RatPoly :** 43/45

30/30 scripts
13/15 style -2: dublicate isn't needed. Because RatTerms are immutable, it's redundant (and actually memory inefficient) to make a deep copy, since it's not possible to mutate RatTerm or its internal fields

**Problem 4 - RatPolyStack:** 19/20

15/15 scripts
4/5 style -1: Stack is a subclass of Vector, so you can use the get(int index) method to directly access specific elements (instead of needing to remove, then re-add elements)

**Problem 5 - CalculatorFrame:** 2/2

**Turnin:** 2/2
