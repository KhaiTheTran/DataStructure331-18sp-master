# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when there is only one possible path

created graph characters
added node GORILLA-MAN to characters
added node HAWK to characters
added node VENUS-II to characters
added edge 1.000 from GORILLA-MAN to HAWK in characters
added edge 1.500 from HAWK to VENUS-II in characters

path from GORILLA-MAN to VENUS-II:
GORILLA-MAN to HAWK with weight 1.000
HAWK to VENUS-II with weight 1.500
total cost: 2.500
