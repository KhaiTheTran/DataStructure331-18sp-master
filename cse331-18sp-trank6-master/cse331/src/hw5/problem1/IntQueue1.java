/**
 * Student Khai Tran
 * 
 * IntQueue1 is our first implementation of a basic first-in, first-out queue
 * for Integers.
 * <p>
 *
 * An IntQueue can be described as [n1, n2, ..., n_k], where n1 is the
 * least-recently-added item in the queue and is the next item to be
 * removed.  n_k is the most-recently-added and will be the last of the
 * current elements to be removed.
 * <p>
 *
 * An IntQueue can also be described constructively, with the append operation,
 * ':', such that [n1, n2, ..., n_k] : n_k+1 is the result of enqueing n_k+1
 * at the end of the queue.
