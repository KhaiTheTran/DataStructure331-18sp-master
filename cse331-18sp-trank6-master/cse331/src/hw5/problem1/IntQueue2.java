/**
 * IntQueue2 is our second implementation of a basic first-in, first-out queue
 * for Integers.
 * <p>
 *
 * An IntQueue can be described as [n1, n2, ..., n_k], where n1 is the
 * least-recently-added item in the queue and is the next item to be
 * removed.  n_k is the most-recently-added and will be the last of the
 * current elements to be removed.
 * <p>
 *
 * An IntQueue can also be described constructively, with the append operation,
 * ':', such that [n1, n2, ..., n_k] : n_k+1 is the result of enqueing n_k+1
 * at the end of the queue.

public class IntQueue2 {
    // This class represents a queue as a circular ring buffer. An array
    // stores the values in the queue. Because the number of elements
    // currently in the queue is usually less than the size of the
    // array, we store the index of the first item in the queue and the
    // total number of elements in the queue. For example, a queue with 4
    // items might look like this:
    //
    // [__ __ n1 n2 n3 n4 __ __]
    //        ^front   ^front+size-1
    //
    // As items are enqueued, front remains unchanged while size is
    // incremented.  As items are dequeued, front is incremented and size
    // is decremented.

    // Normally, your abstraction function and representation invarant would go
    // here. For ease of grading, please place them in hw5/answers.txt
    // instead with your answers to the other written exercises.
