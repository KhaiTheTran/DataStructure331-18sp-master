# Test graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed

# Create a graph
created graph graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed

# Add two nodes
added node xx to graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed
added node yy to graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed

# Add two edges
added edge xxyy from xx to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed
added edge yyxx from yy to xx in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from xx,
# and outgoing from yy
graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed contains: xx yy
the children of xx in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed are: yy(xxyy)
the children of yy in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdgesMixed are: xx(yyxx)
