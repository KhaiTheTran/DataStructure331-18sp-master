# Test graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges

# Create a graph
created graph graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges

# Add two nodes
added node xx to graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges
added node yy to graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges

# Add five edges
added edge xxxx from xx to xx in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges
added edge xxyy9 from xx to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges
added edge xxyy99 from xx to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges
added edge yyxx from yy to xx in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges
added edge yyyy from yy to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from xx,
# and outgoing from yy
graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges contains: xx yy
the children of xx in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges are: xx(xxxx) yy(xxyy9) yy(xxyy99)
the children of yy in graphCreated_twoNode_moreEdges are: xx(yyxx) yy(yyyy)
