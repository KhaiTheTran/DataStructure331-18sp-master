# Test graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge

# Create a graph
created graph graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge

# Add two nodes
added node xx to graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge
added node yy to graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge

# Add four edges
added edge xxxx from xx to xx in graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge
added edge xxyy from xx to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge
added edge yyxx from yy to xx in graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge
added edge yyyy from yy to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from xx,
# and outgoing edge from yy
graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge contains: xx yy
the children of xx in graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge are: xx(xxxx) yy(xxyy)
the children of yy in graphCreated_twoNode_fourEdge are: xx(yyxx) yy(yyyy)
