# Create a graph
created graph graphCreated_oneNode_oneEdge

# Add a node
added node xx to graphCreated_oneNode_oneEdge

# Add an edge
added edge xxxx from xx to xx in graphCreated_oneNode_oneEdge

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from xx
graphCreated_oneNode_oneEdge contains: xx
the children of xx in graphCreated_oneNode_oneEdge are: xx(xxxx)
