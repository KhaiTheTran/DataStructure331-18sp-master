# Test graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder

# Create a graph
created graph graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder

# Add two nodes in backward order
added node yy to graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder
added node xx to graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from xx,
# and outgoing from yy
graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder contains: xx yy
the children of xx in graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder are:
the children of yy in graphCreated_twoNode_alphaOrder are:
