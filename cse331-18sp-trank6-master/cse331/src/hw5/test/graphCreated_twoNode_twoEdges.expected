# Test graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges

# Create a graph
created graph graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges

# Add two nodes
added node xx to graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges
added node yy to graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges

# Add two edges
added edge xxxx from xx to xx in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges
added edge yyxx from xx to yy in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from xx,
# and outgoing from yy
graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges contains: xx yy
the children of xx in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges are: xx(xxxx) yy(yyxx)
the children of yy in graphCreated_twoNode_twoEdges are:
